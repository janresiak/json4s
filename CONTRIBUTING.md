### Issues

- Please describe about your issue in detail (verison, situation, examples)
- We may close your issue when we have no plan to take action right now. We appreciate your understanding.

### Pull Requests

- Pull requests basically should be sent toward "3.6" branch
- Source/binary compatibility always must be kept as far as possible
- Prefer creating scala source code for each class/object/trait (of course, except for sealed trait)
- json4s build checks binary compatibility by using [MiMa](https://github.com/typesafehub/migration-manager/wiki/Sbt-plugin) for maintenance releases (e.g. 3.3.x).
